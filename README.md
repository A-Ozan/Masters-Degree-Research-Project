# Masters-Degree-Research-Project
This is the official repository of [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozan-a-96596b309) Masters research project and those of my colleagues, [Oliver B.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivermbu/) and [Florian K.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-kohn/).

This project is concerned with the implementation of a holistic cyber security monitoring tool using various security technologies so that micro-enterprises can monitor their network with as little effort and at low cost as possible. The security technologies used are:

| Tool | Beschreibung |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Opnsense](https://opnsense.org/)      | An open-source firewall and routing platform that offers security features such as VPN, IDS/IPS and web filtering. |
| [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)         | An open-source security detection, monitoring and response platform that provides log analysis, threat detection and integrity checking. |
| [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/elasticsearch) | A distributed search and analysis engine for storing and quickly retrieving large amounts of data.     |
| [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/de/logstash)      | A data processing pipeline tool that collects and processes logs and other data sources and sends them to various outputs, often to Elasticsearch. |
| [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/de/kibana)        | A visualisation tool for Elasticsearch that creates dashboards and visualises data in real time. |
